Simplifying assumptions:
 - Fixed framesize - 256 bytes
 - No fragmenting

Ether registers module . Need a module generator from AMAP spec.

Registers:
    command /* start operation , stop operation? */
    read frame base address
    read frame read pointer (read by SW, pointer update by HW)
    read frame write pointer (read by HW, pointer update by SW)
    read frame size
    write frame base address
    write frame size
    write frame read pointer (read by HW, pointer update by HW.)
    write frame write pointer (write by SW, pointer update by SW.)

    if (read frame available and read buffer not full)

data transfer:
Frame boundary handling on FIFO and on memory. 
Force a fixed length  on the FIFO and on memory. 
No split frames. application layer to work with 256 byte size.

So:
FIFO has a width of max frame-length

tx_driver:
    IDLE
        if write frame FIFO non empty go to send.
    PICK ONE DATA
        flop over the data and release the FIFO entry (ready=1)
    Send one frame
        /* Assume frame is already in network order ready to go? */ 

/* FIFO may back pressure and UDP packets may be lost. */
rx_driver
    IDLE
        if somethings on the RX.
    Get Nibble
        flop into the frame
        if frame_complete Put on FIFO
    put on FIFO
        send to FIFO,
        if (FIFO picked the data, got to IDLE)
